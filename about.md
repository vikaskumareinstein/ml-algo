## About
Hi There !!!.I am Vikas Kumar ,currently studying in National Institute of Technology,Arunachal Pradesh pursuing my Bachelor Degree in Computer Science(B.Tech).I am a Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence enthusiast who likes to work on the real life implementation of it.I am a Free Open Source Software(FOSS) contributor/supporter and very much fascinated towards autonomous vehicles, as a result, I got interested in deep learning. I have worked on several projects, some of them are:
- `Face recognition (HoG detection)on Raspberry Pi`[link](https://github.com/vikaskumareinstein/facial-recognition/) <br>(Computer Vision , Machine Learning)
- `QR Code Scanning using Camera Module (Rpi)`[link](https://github.com/vikaskumareinstein/facial-recognition/)<br>(Computer Vision, pyzbar-python)
- `Wind Speed Prediction` <br>(Time Series Forecasting, Machine Learning >>*Will be published soon*)
- `Model Pruning: Traffic Signal Classification Dataset` <br>(Tensorflow, OpenCV)
- `Autonomous Drone Flight Controller` <br>(Drones, Autonomous flight *WIP* )
- `Divorce Prediction` <br>(Machine Learning, Data Mining  >>*Will be published soon*)
- `Automatic COVID-19 detection using Chest X-ray` <br>(Deep Learning, Computer Vision >>*submitted at elsevier*)
- `Brain Tumor Segmentation`  <br>(Deep Learning)

Recently, I am enjoying learning the application of Machine Learning and Deep Learning in the field of Robotics. In case of any query feel free to drop a mail to: [vikaskumareinstein@gmail.com](vikaskumareinstein@gmail.com)

Last but not least: the [Jekyll documentation](http://jekyllrb.com) is the best starting point!

Enjoy!
