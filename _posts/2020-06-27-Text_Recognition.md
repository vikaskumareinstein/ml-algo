title: LeNet - CNN in python Text Recognition
---

In this blog we will be discussing Text Recognition and going to implement a simple but revolutionary Convolutional Neural Network : LeNet.The LeNet architecture is simple and doesnot take very much computational power.It will run on the CPU.

We are going to implement it using Python and Keras.Keras is an open-source neural network library in Python.It is mainly build for deep neural networks.
