title: Decision Trees

Decision Trees are widely used models for classification as well as regression tasks. In this approach in order to distinguish between certain class a series of if/else questions are asked and based on the answers the items are classified.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ___A decision tree to distinguish among several animals.___

In the above scenario we build model to distinguish between four classes of animals namely: hawks,penguins,dolphins, and bears.Some features were defined like: "has feathers" , "can fly" , "has fins" etc.

We are going to look into a practical problem of Decision tree classifier in which we will be using breast cancer dataset from sklearn library.

>from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier<br>
<br>
>cancer = load_breast_cancer()<br>
>X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
cancer.data, cancer.target, stratify=cancer.target, random_state=42)<br>
>tree = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=0)<br>
>tree.fit(X_train, y_train)<br>
>print("Accuracy on training set: {:.3f}".format(tree.score(X_train, y_train)))<br>
>print("Accuracy on test set: {:.3f}".format(tree.score(X_test, y_test)))<br>

After running the above code result is as folllow:
>Accuracy on training set: 1.000<br>
>Accuracy on test set: 0.937<br>


The accuracy on the training set is 100% as the model has learned all the labels and the leaf are all pure.We need to restrict the depth of the tree. so we will set the `max_depth=4` in the code.

>tree = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=4, random_state=0)<br>
>tree.fit(X_train, y_train)<br>
>print("Accuracy on training set: {:.3f}".format(tree.score(X_train, y_train)))<br>
>print("Accuracy on test set: {:.3f}".format(tree.score(X_test, y_test)))<br>

The result are as follows:

>Accuracy on training set: 0.988<br>
>Accuracy on test set: 0.951<br>

Now we will be visualising the tree using a useful library in skelearn : graphviz.

>from sklearn.tree import export_graphviz<br>
>export_graphviz(tree, out_file="tree.dot", class_names=["malignant", "benign"],
feature_names=cancer.feature_names, impurity=False, filled=True)<br>

Now the export_graphviz function has converted the visualization in dot file, now reading and visualizing the dot file yield:

>import graphviz<br>
<br>
>with open("tree.dot") as f:<br>
>dot_graph = f.read()<br>
>graphviz.Source(dot_graph)<br>

Now we can get the relevant visualization of the dataset.
