NumPy:
It is one of the fundamental package used in Machine Learning and Scientific Computing in Python.It contains ndarrays as its core data structure.It has the fuctionality to represent entities to multidimensional arrays and perform various manipulations as well as high-level mathematical computations.Various libraries take Numpy arrays as fundamental datastructure.Some of the code snippets of numpy:
`import numpy as np
 x=np.array([])`
