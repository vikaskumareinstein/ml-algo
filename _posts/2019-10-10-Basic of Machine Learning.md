title: Basics of Machine Learning
---
Machine learning involves extracting knowledge from data using various suitable algorithms.It is the intersection of statistics,artificial intelligence and computer science.We try to get a generalisation from the data according to our scenario.
Machine learning is basically categorised into three components:
=>Supervised Learning 
=>Unsupervised Learning
=>Reinforcement Learning

Supervised Learning:
Supervised Learning deals with the data with labels i.e. data which are known.Mainly supervised algorithms solve two type of problems:Regression and Classification problems.Regression means predicting a continuous value based on the trend.Classification means putting a particular datapoints in a predefined category.

Unsupervised Learning:
The data which is available is not labelled.We dont know about the data,we only know the magnitude of the data.Unsupervised learning solves segmentation problem, detecting abnormal access patterns, identification of topics ,etc.

Reinforcement Learning:
It is the learning more about how a young child learns.In this learning an agent tries to maximise reward in various situations.Autonomous driving,playing atari games,etc. are some of the problems which RL algorithm solves.
