title: k-armed Bandit Problem and related algorithms
---

In this blog we will be discussing about the k-armed bandit problem i.e. slot machines.We will be getting some rewards by pulling the lever of the machine which has (in this scenario) stationary probability distribution.Putting more simply,the reward will not change over time for the given slot machine.The reward is fixed for each slot machine but not known to us.Through repeated actions (in this case pulling the lever) we have to maximise the reward.

We denote the action selected on time step t as A_t and the corresponding reward as R_t.So, the value of any arbitrary action *a* is the expected reward given *a* is selected :
> q_*(*a*)=E[R_t|A_t=*a*].

>**EXPECTED REWARD**
>Expectation of any random variable is the sum of all the possible values weighted by its probability.So,the above formula can be interpreted as Probability of reward R_t=r given A_t=a multiplied by
