---
Tools to be explored:
NumPy 
Scipy
Matplotlib 
Ipython
Scikit-learn
Jupyter Notebook

NumPy:
It is one of the fundamental package used in Machine Learning and Scientific Computing in Python.It contains ndarrays as its core data structure.It has the fuctionality to represent entities to multidimensional arrays and perform various manipulations as well as high-level mathematical computations.Various libraries take Numpy arrays as fundamental datastructure.Some of the code snippets of numpy:
`import numpy as np
 x=np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]])
 print("x array is :\n",x)`
 
 The more detailed documentation about numpy can be found at "https://numpy.org/doc/"


Scipy:
As written on the official website of scipy-"A Python-based ecosystem of open-source software for mathmatics, science and engineering". Scipy is a collection of functions for scientific computing in Python.It has many available functionalities for linear algebra,Optimisation, statistical distribution ,signal Processing and many more.
Code Snippets:
`.................................`

The more detailed documentation of Scipy can be found at "https://www.scipy.org/".

Matplotlib:
Since data visualization is one of the key components in analysing the data and getting  insights.Matplotlib is the library for scientific plotting and data visualization.It provides functionalities for making quality visualization such as charts,histograms,scatter plot,3D plot etc.
Code Snippets:
`................................`

More detailed documentation of matplotlib can be found at "https://matplotlib.org/contents.html".

Pandas:

Pandas is an open-source software library for data-analysis and manipulation based on Python.It has data-structures and operations for the manipulation of the numerical tables and time series.
The core datastructure(an object) is dataframe which is used for data manipulation with integrated indexing.
Code Snippets:
