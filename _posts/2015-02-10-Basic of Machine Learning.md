Machine learning involves extracting knowledge from data using various suitable algorithms.It is the intersection of statistics,artificial intelligence and computer science.We try to get a generalisation from the data according to our scenario.
Machine learning is basically categorised into three components:
=>Supervised Learning 
=>Unsupervised Learning
=>Reinforcement Learning

Supervised Learning:
